# org.eclipse.winery.model.tosca

This implements [Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications Version 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA/v1.0/os/TOSCA-v1.0-os.html) with extensions by the University of Stuttgart and others.

The java classes were generated out of `TOSCA-v1.0.xsd`.

## Breaking changes in the XSD

`TOSCA-v1.0.xsd` was adapted.
The XSD is currently located at [TOSCA-v1.0.xsd](../org.eclipse.winery.common/src/main/resources/TOSCA-v1.0.xsd), because the code from `common` is not yet migrated here.
The modifications are listed inside the `.xsd`.
